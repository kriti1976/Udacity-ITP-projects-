    <p> All a panda does all day is to eat and sleep, you are best to get up early for a visit to a panda park,
     so you see them when they are active.They spend as long as 14 hours eating per day, and spend the rest of their time in sleeping. 
     Pandas can poop as much as 28 kilos/day. In the past the undigested bamboo pieces in the poop were made into picture
     frames and bookmarks no, apparently they did not smell!</p>
